## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Alternatively, provide the full path with double backslashes
hrs <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/bill_/Desktop/Final/housing.csv", fileEncoding = "latin1")
```

```{r}
# Set the scipen option to a high value to avoid scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)

# Plot the data with adjusted y-axis limits
plot(hrs$median_income, hrs$median_house_value, 
     main = "value vs income", 
     xlab = "income", 
     ylab = "value", 
     ylim = c(0, 600000))  # Adjust the upper limit as needed
```
